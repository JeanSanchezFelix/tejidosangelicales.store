# **Tejidos Angelicales Store**  

This website is a modern platform for selling crochet products, designed to provide a seamless and interactive shopping experience. Built using **Bootstrap** and **React**, it combines aesthetic appeal with functionality to support a small crochet business.  



## **Motivation**  

This project was inspired by the desire to help a friend take her crochet business to the next level. Moving from Facebook sales to a dedicated platform not only showcases her talent but also ensures a more professional and organized presentation of her work.  
As a software engineering student, this project was an opportunity to apply my skills, learn, and contribute meaningfully to a real-world cause.

## **Code Example**  

Here's a snippet demonstrating how to calculate the order summary in the shopping cart:  

```javascript
function updateOrderSummary() {
    let subtotal = 0;
    productRows.forEach(row => {
        const quantityCell = row.querySelector('.quantity-column');
        const priceCell = row.querySelector('.price-column');
        const price = parseFloat(priceCell.innerText.replace('$', ''));
        let quantity = parseInt(quantityCell.innerText);

        if (quantity <= 0) {
            row.style.display = 'none';
        } else {
            row.style.display = 'table-row';
            subtotal += price * quantity;
        }
    });

    orderSubtotalElement.innerText = `$${subtotal.toFixed(2)}`;

    const shippingCost = checkedSwitch.checked ? 10.00 : 0.00;
    const taxRate = 0.115;
    const taxCost = subtotal * taxRate;
    const totalCost = subtotal + shippingCost + taxCost;

    shippingCostElement.innerText = `$${shippingCost.toFixed(2)}`;
    taxCostElement.innerText = `$${taxCost.toFixed(2)}`;
    totalCostElement.innerText = `$${totalCost.toFixed(2)}`;
}
```
